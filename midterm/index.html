                        <p>Starfish are an extreamly interesting species, here are some facts that will peak your interest and help you learn more about them! One of the first facts most people think about when they hear starfish is the fact that they can regrow lost limbs. A neat add on to this fact is that there have been cases where starfish have regrown their entire bodies just from a detached limb! Another cool fact is that there are over 2000 species (some listed below) of starfish discovered so far, some that even have over 40 limbs! They are also capable of living up to 35 years! Starfish have no blood, they instead use sea water, and pump it through their nervous system. Although they use sea water as a substitute for blood, they cannont survive in fresh whater at all. The size of starfish usually ranges between 4.7 to 9.4 inches in diameter. Finally, the scientific name of the starfish is "<i>Asteroidea</i>".</p>
