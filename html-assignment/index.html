        <article><h2>About Me</h2></article>
        <p>My name is Cameron, I am 18 years old, my birthday is September 12<sup>th</sup>, and I am student at Algonquin College. I have a <strong>very</strong> large family, consisting of 3 siblings, <abbr title= "including step parents">4 parents</abbr>, and 3 dogs. In my free time, I like playing video games, reading and skiing if it's the winter. Once it's safer to do so, I'd also like to travel more.</p>
        <p>Some of my favourite video games are Dark Souls, Super Smash Bros and Legend of Zelda. I find video games to be a nice hobby while the pandemic is still so prominent as you can play them with your friends without having to worry about getting sick. Although sometimes I need to remember to take a break to get some exercise!</p>
